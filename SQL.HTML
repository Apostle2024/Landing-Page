--Question 1: Extract StudentId, FullName, EmailAddress, PhoneNumber, Onboarding Date, Level, Sex and Student Role and School Fees

--Step 1 - Identify all tables that contain the information.
--Students contains these (Extract StudentId, FullName, EmailAddress, PhoneNumber, Onboarding Date)
--Levels contains (Level and School Fees)
--Genders contains (Sex)
--Roles contains (Role)

--Step 2: - Identify the fields/Columns that contain the information
--Students StudentId, FirstName Conc. (+) LastName with a space in between, EmailAddress, PhoneNumber and StartDate (Onboarding Date)
--Levels has Description as the Levels
--Gender has Description as Gender
--Roles has Description as Role

--Step 3: Identify the primary table
-- The Primary key is the table that contains most of the foreign keys.
-- Students contains three foreign keys hence is the main table

--Step 4: Write the actual query to extract the required information observing the proper SQL syntax

--Recal Step 1 - Identify all tables that contain the information.
--Students contains these (Extract StudentId, FullName, EmailAddress, PhoneNumber, Onboarding Date)
--Levels contains (Level and School Fees)
--Genders contains (Sex)
--Roles contains (Role)

SQL
SUBQUERIES

it is a query embedded in the WHERE clause of another query 

RULES
