UDACITY 
WEB address 
web address is called a url
U: UNiform 
R: Resource 
L:Locator 

UNiform: STANDARDIZE
Resource: file or data object 
Locator: address for finding something 

correct: <a href="http://www.example.com"></a>  fully qualified url or absolute url 

http: tells the bbrowser where to use secure or insecure encryption to connect to server 

http, https, file are all protocols or ways browser can get something 

http://en.wikipedia.org/
https//en.wikipedia.org/
file://users/kelly/notes.html

//en.wikipedia.org/ is the domain name 

file url dont have domain name because no server 
because its the browser reading url of computerr

last componenet is the file path /users/kelly/notes.html, /

https://www.ddd.edu


<a> stands for anchor</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/"></a>
href= hyper text refrence 

attribute goes into the tag at the begining not the end 


<a href=""https://google.com"><img src="googlr.png"alt="google!!"> </a>

files and relative url 
<placebear class="com"></placebear>

<img src="https://placebear.com/800/900" alt="bear">

if file is in computer
<img src="kitten.jpg" alt="yah kitten"> ======relative url 

rule it will look for file name as as variation of html own url

relative url 
browser looks for file in the same directory 

to send to someone = 
image on web server == use full URL //
if it is an image u are passing along with your html file use relative url 
relative url are the reason u cant make an a link 
without / google treat as a relative URL
to ref another site use full URL
